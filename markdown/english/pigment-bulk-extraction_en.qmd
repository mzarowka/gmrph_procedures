# Bulk pigment extraction from lake sediments

## Consumables and equipment

### Chemical reagents

-   Acetone **100%** (grade **HPLC**): solvent.

-   Acetone **technical**: cleaning.

-   **Redistilled water (*MilliQ*)**.

-   Technical nitrogen.

-   Neodisher Laboclean.

    | Neodisher LaboClean FLA: liquid, highly-alkaline cleaning, dispergator agent.

### Equipment

-   Laboratory fume hood.

::: callout-caution
## Acetone

Acetone (C~3~H~6~O) is an organic solvent requiring work under the **running fume hood**.

Acetone is highly **flammable** and is an **irritant.**
:::

-   Ultrasound bath.

-   Centrifuge.

-   Vortex shaker.

-   Laboratory furnace for glassware baking.

-   Laboratory oven.

-   Freeze drier.

-   Glass beakers for acetone pippeting.

-   Acetone pipette **1000 µl** and tips (for acetone).

-   Heating plate.

-   Nitrogen evaporator.

    -   Needles for N~2~ evaporator.

    -   Metal rack for amber vials on the heating plate.

    | For example *Turbovap* instrument.

-   Racks for centrifuge tubes and amber vials.

-   Analytical balance, antistatic device and stainless steel spatula.

-   Ice bath.

    | Plastic tray with cooling packs.

-   Crimper (for closing HPLC vials).

### Other

-   Polypropylene (PP) centrifuge tubes (falcons) **25 ml** or **50 ml** (Corning™).

    | Other plastics will melt in contact with acetone.
    | One-time use.

-   Amber vials with caps **25 ml** or **50 ml**.

    | Tape the labels.

-   PTFE hydrophobic filters of **0.2 μm** (**13 mm**).

    | One-time use.

-   Polypropylene (PP) small syringes with Luer Lock for filtering (**2 ml**).

    | One-time use.

::: callout-important
Always check size and fit compatibility.
:::

-   Aluminum foil.

-   Glass Pasteur pipettes.

    | One-time use.

-   Silicone nipples for pipettes.

## Cleaning

### Amber vials

-   Put into soap water with Neodisher Laboclean for few hours.

-   Wash in the washing machine.

    | Glassware program and Neodisher Laboclean.

-   Dry in the drying oven.

-   Close with aluminum foil (cleaned with technical acetone).

-   Bake in the furnace in **500 °C**.

    | Minimum **3 h**.

### Amber vials caps

-   Rinse with tap water.

-   Put into beaker filled with **technical acetone** and **redistilled water (MilliQ)** mixture (**1:1**).

    -   Sonicate for **10 minutes**.

-   Put into beaker filled with **technical acetone**.

    -   Sonicate for **10 minutes**.

-   Dry in the drying oven.

    | Washing solvents can be used again. Store in the glass bottles.

### Evaporator needles {#sec-igły-do-ewaporatora}

-   Put into beaker filled with **technical acetone**.

-   Sonicate **3 × 10 minutes**.

### Disposal

-   Acetone accordingly.

-   PP falcons and glass Pasteur pipettes need to be washed and recycled.

## Sediment preparation

-   Freeze dry.

    | High temperature speeds up pigment degradation.

-   Loss on ignition **550 °C**.

    | Paleoenvironmental Research Laboratory: calculate organic matter from CNS.

-   Weigh **0.5 g** homogenized sediments into polypropylene falcons (PP) **25 ml**.

    | Clean tools with technical acetone, use antistatic device.
    | If there is not enough material, use no less than **0.25 g**.

-   Label falcon and cap with sample name.

## Pigment extraction

-   Prepare workplace, cover surfaces under the fume hood with aluminum foil cleaned with technical acetone.

-   Switch off the lights whenever possible.

-   Fill glass beaker with **100%** acetone.

    | Don't pipette from the bottle.

-   Rinse pipette with acetone.

    | Pipette into waste beaker.

-   Add **5 ml** of acetone to the falcon.

    | pipette right, there should be no air bubbles in the tip.

-   Shake with vortex for **1 minute**.

-   Sonicate for **1 minute**.

-   Centrifuge:

    -   **10 minutes**.

    -   **5000 rpm**.

    | This step needs to be adjusted to the centrifuge. Lower rpm requires longer centrifugation.

-   Check if supernatant is clear after centrifugation.

    | If it is not clear centrifugate again.

-   Remove (transfer) supernatant using glass Pasteur pipette into amber vial.

    | Label amber vial accordingly.
    | Be sure all supernatant is transferred.

-   Repeat two times using **5 ml** acetone each time.

-   Hold labelled Pasteur pipettes in a glass beaker between the extraction steps.

    | Every amber vial and falcon has its own Pasteur pipette.

-   Amber vials between extraction steps should be covered from light and stored in the ice bath.

    | After **three extraction cycles**, if supernatant still has a strong color continue with **additional extraction steps**.
    | It is important that **all samples** are prepared **the same way**.
    | Extracts can be stored **for a few days** in the **-20 °C** temperature.

## Concentration and reconstitution

### Evaporation

-   Set heating plate and nitrogen evaporator.

-   Evaporate samples to dry residue.

| Before use be sure that needles are clean (@sec-igły-do-ewaporatora).

-   Put amber vials in the rack on the heating plate set to **35 °C**.

-   Open nitrogen flow.

| Set flow so small flexion of the liquid surface is visible.

-   Evaporate to dry residue (around **4** to **6 h**).

### Reconstitution and filtering

-   Add **2 ml** **100%** acetone to the amber vial using **1000 µl** pipette.

| Be very precise, check for air bubbles in the pipette tip.

-   Homogenize solution with the glass Pasteur pipette.

-   Rinse the vial walls and *vortex*.

| All pigments need to redissolve in the acetone.

-   Take a **2 mL** syringe, attach the **0.2 µm** PTFE hydrophobic filter on.

-   Pipette directly with a pateur pipette into the syringe.

-   Pass the solvent through the filter into the small HPLC glass vials with the piston.

-   Loose the filter from the syringe to get all solvent out.

-   Close the HPLC vials with a crimper and store your samples in a labelled sample box at -20 °C.
